  <h1>Noodle Salad</h1>

  <p>This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple. It is bursting with flavor and makes great use of leftover grilled meat or shrimp.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</li>
    <li>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</li>
  </ol>
